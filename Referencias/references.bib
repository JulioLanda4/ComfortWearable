   abstract = {This paper presents an exhaustive overview of the field studies carried out in the past few decades on human thermal comfort. To get a better grasp of patterns in observed data and to facilitate comparison across investigations, the thermal comfort field studies are grouped using the Köppen-Geiger climatic classification of their locations. Effects of relevant environmental, physiological, and other aspects that can have an effect on thermal comfort are reviewed and discussed. Field studies across the board show that people have considerable capacity to adapt to their surroundings provided they have sufficient adaptive opportunities. This observation holds good for both air-conditioned as well as free running buildings. However, studies show that conditioned spaces have narrower comfort zones compared to free running buildings. Across climatic zones, most popular means of adaptation are related to the modification of air movement and clothing. The ease, economy, and effectiveness (the 3 'E's) of adaptive opportunities play a major role in occupants' adaptation to the surroundings. Studies show that individuals are likely to perceive the same thermal environment differently and environments lacking adaptive avenues normally receive poor comfort ratings. Studies also indicate that for adaptive comfort equations, the running mean temperature may be a better outdoor index compared to the monthly mean temperature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Academic exploration of energy democracy has produced a rich theorization of its foundations that exhibits significant pluralism in response to different geographic, social, ideological and technical contexts. This paper develops the literature by considering how sociotechnical transitions associated with energy system digitalization may affect the theory and praxis of energy democracy. Our analysis draws on three dimensions of energy democracy: popular sovereignty, participatory governance, and civic ownership. Digitalization is shown to both present challenges and new avenues for the exercise and study of energy democracy. Firstly, digitalization simultaneously enables and constrains the exercise of popular sovereignty by diversifying energy citizen roles and complicating accountability. Secondly, digitalization creates new dimensions of risk around skills, knowledge and resource access, which can exclude citizens from participatory governance. Thirdly, digitalization challenges common conceptions of civic ownership by introducing new material-software dependencies and re-defining the assets that underpin the energy system. Finally, digitalization fundamentally changes the nature of decision-making, potentially undermining current understandings of the concept and its democratic function. Further exploration of ‘digital energy democracy’ would hold value for research and practice in the sector.},

   abstract = {Buildings consume huge amounts of energy and utilize most of it for occupants’ thermal comfort satisfaction. Real-time thermal comfort assessment can enormously contribute to thermal comfort optimization and energy conservation in buildings. Existing thermal comfort models mainly utilize classification algorithms to identify personal thermal comfort states, resulting in significant information loss. In addition, existing thermal comfort studies mainly use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) feature extraction to compute the power of the Low-frequency (LF) and High-frequency (HF) bands of the R–R intervals (RRIs), resulting in the insufficient use of the information in the RRIs. To account for these concerns, this study defines personal thermal sensation as a continuous function of time, and investigates using the Hilbert Transform (HT) to extract the instantaneous amplitude (iA) of the LF and HF for thermal comfort modeling. Moreover, a novel continuous thermal sensation acquisition system has been designed to obtain the subjects’ approximate continuous thermal sensation. The FFT-based HRV features, HT-based HRV features, and time-domain HRV features have all been shown to be relevant for personal thermal comfort modeling. By utilizing machine learning regressions, it is feasible to combine the HT-based HRV features and other HRV features together to boost personal thermal comfort prediction accuracy. The subjects’ personal thermal comfort prediction reached the highest average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.73 by using all the HRV features together. This study facilitates practical applications for wearable thermal comfort assessment frameworks and contributes to energy conservation in buildings.},

   abstract = {Thermal comfort prediction of building occupants can be remarkably instrumental for both ensuring a comfortable living environment, and improving building energy-efficiency through strategic ambient-control based on the occupant's thermal state index (TSI: Cool-Discomfort/Comfort/Warm-Discomfort). This paper proposes a personal TSI prediction method termed as the enhanced Predicted Thermal State (ePTS) method by sensing physiological parameters namely, hand skin temperature and pulse rate, along with the ambient air temperature. The ePTS method is developed through significant enhancements over our previous skin temperature based PTS model. First, we investigate pulse rate as a potential TSI predictor. Second, we propose a logic-gated normalization process to address the individual differences in pulse rate. Third, we develop a spectral analysis approach to formulate a new pulse rate feature. Consequently, six significant TSI predictive features are curated that map the TSI based on an optimized Support Vector Machine algorithm. The method is compared with 5 different input cases and 3 state-of-the-art methods. Pulse rate is revealed to be a significant TSI predictor subject to the occupant's gender and BMI. The ePTS method achieves the highest accuracy at over 97%, outperforming the PTS model (82%), and other physiology based methods (82%–94%). The study is substantiated with extensive real human experiments in regulated thermal environment. The method is deemed adaptive by its machine-learning framework, robust by normalization, and non-intrusive by convenience of measurement. It may be realized by integrating the wearable and ambient sensor networks with the Internet-of-Things for a comfortable and energy-efficient building.},

Personal comfort systems (PCS) address this individual variability, and also enable more energy-efficient thermal conditioning in buildings by reducing the need for tight indoor temperature control. This study evaluates a novel approach to PCS that leverages the time-dependence of human thermal perception. A 6.25 cm2 wearable device, Embr Wave, delivers dynamic waveforms of cooling or warming to the inner wrist. In three thermal comfort tests conducted in a climate chamber with N = 49 subjects and temperatures between 20 and 28 °C, the device exhibited a corrective potential of 2.5 °C within 3 min for both warm and cool populations, while consuming ~1 W of power. The effect is even more pronounced (corrective potential up to 3.3 °C over periods of 3- and 45-min) when subjects are given control of the device's operation. Subjects are found to optimize the device settings for pleasantness, not for the intensity of sensation. These results indicate that this low-power, wearable device improves whole-body thermal sensation, comfort, and pleasantness. It is an appropriate tool for addressing the problem of thermal discomfort in moderate indoor environments.},

   abstract = {Thermal comfort is a critical issue in achieving an acceptable indoor environment and managing building energy use. However, it is difficult to precisely recognize thermal comfort because its determination varies depending on the characteristics of humans and indoor spaces. Moreover, accumulating datasets of indoor environmental and individual features is challenging in terms of both collection time and cost, and is sometimes unrealistic. This study established a prediction model for individual thermal comfort to mitigate this challenge. This model is based on ensemble transfer learning (TL) to transfer knowledge from datasets of someone in different indoor spaces and thermal environments, even if the physiological and environmental data of the target subject are insufficient. First, the physiological data of each subject and the indoor environmental data were collected from wearable wristbands and sensors. Then, a pre-trained model was developed with the datasets by combining deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Based on the pre-trained model, the ensemble TL method was applied to overcome the weak generalization performance that occurred when the dataset of each target subject was insufficient. The results revealed that the ensemble TL more accurately predicted the thermal comfort of two target subjects using the pre-trained model from a source. The accuracy and F1-score were both 95% for the first subject. For the second subject, they were calculated as 85% and 83%, respectively. It was also found that the ensemble TL was suitable for application when using fewer and imbalanced datasets in the target domains.},

   abstract = {Much evidence has shown that each individual has different needs, preferences, and expectations of the indoor thermal environment, which may cause potential excessive energy use. Incorporating an individualized comfort model is a new approach to characterizing individual thermal comfort and serves as a basis for a smart building paradigm. The major issue for such model development is related to the complexity of individual data collection and the ignorance of micro-environmental parameters. This paper intends to design, develop, and demonstrate an innovative alert-based occupant-responsive framework for capturing individualized thermal comfort-related data and predicting individualized thermal preference by leveraging wearable sensors and computing technologies. By applying a pre-defined alert algorithm to micro-environmental and individual physiological data, this sensing system can automatically capture pronounced data fluctuations. The data collection efficiency and effectiveness are enhanced with the alert algorithm compared with the scheduled surveys used in previous studies. The continuous participation of the researchers to disrupt the subjects for the surveys during the experiments is also avoided. The individual thermal preference prediction models achieved high overall accuracy, >94% with about 110 data points for subject A and 150 for B. Through the analysis of features' relative importance and their interactive effects, this work also shows the features’ characteristics and distinctions in predicting the thermal preferences of different individuals. This feature contribution analysis highlights the key influential parameters for an individual and may support the optimization potential of individualized comfort conditions and energy usage for building heating and cooling. The developed system also features the role of alerting functions in the automatic collection of subjective user data and facilitating smart building integration as well.},

The proposed watch-type sweat rate sensors reduce operation power by minimizing expansion fluid volume to 0.4 ml through heat circuit modeling. The proposed sensors reduce operation power to 12.8% and weight to 47.6% compared to previous portable sensors, operating for 4 hours at 6 V batteries.

Average sweat rate difference for each thermal status measured in three subjects shows (32.06 ± 27.19) g/m <sup>2</sup> h in thermal statuses including ‘comfortable’, ‘slightly warm’, ‘warm’, and ‘hot’. The proposed sensors thereby can discriminate and compare four stages of thermal status.

Different daily routines and their relation to the thermal sensation remain a challenge in long-term monitoring campaigns. This paper presents a new methodology to investigate the correlation between individuals’ daily Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) and environmental exposure. Participants engaged in the long-term campaign were instructed to answer a daily survey about thermal comfort perception and wore a device continuously monitoring temperature and relative humidity in their surroundings. Normalized daily profiles of monitored variables and calculated heat index were clustered to identify common exposure profiles for each participant. The correlation between each cluster and expressed TSV was evaluated through the Kendall tau-b test. Most of the significant correlations were related to the heat index profiles, i.e., 49% of cases, suggesting that a more detailed description of physical boundaries better approximates expressed comfort. This research represents the first step towards personalized comfort models accounting for individual long-term environmental exposure.

Accordingly, developing an individual (or personal) thermal comfort model based on continuous observation of biomarkers (often measured by wearable devices) has received much research attention in recent years. Whilst almost all the comfort prediction models presented in the literature are based on a data-driven approach and machine learning techniques, this paper presents a novel theoretical model aimed at explaining the causal relationship in the prediction of thermal sensations based on key environmental and physiological parameters, incl. skin temperature, heart rate, and air temperature. The proposed model is grounded on the ASHRAE thermal sensation index (TSENS) and is based on mediating effects of thermoregulatory and cardiac responses. The new model's performance was evaluated under different thermal environmental conditions by comparing it against the PMV values and the experimental data available from the literature. Results showed that the proposed model could accurately predict individual thermal sensations by monitoring the air temperature, overall or wrist skin temperature, and heart rate (or metabolic rate). This model can provide new insight into individual thermal comfort assessment and can be used alone or in combination with data-driven machine learning models for continuous monitoring of thermal comfort conditions.},

   abstract = {<p> Global climate is changing as a result of anthropogenic warming, leading to higher daily excursions of temperature in cities. Such elevated temperatures have great implications on human thermal comfort and heat stress, which should be closely monitored. Current methods for heat exposure assessments (surveys, microclimate measurements, and laboratory experiments), however, present several limitations: measurements are scattered in time and space and data gathered on outdoor thermal stress and comfort often does not include physiological and behavioral parameters. To address these shortcomings, Project Coolbit aims to introduce a human-centric approach to thermal comfort assessments. In this study, we propose and evaluate the use of wrist-mounted wearable devices to monitor environmental and physiological responses that span a wide range of spatial and temporal distributions. We introduce an integrated wearable weather station that records (a) microclimate parameters (such as air temperature and humidity), (b) physiological parameters (heart rate, skin temperature and humidity), and (c) subjective feedback. The feasibility of this methodology to assess thermal comfort and heat stress is then evaluated using two sets of experiments: controlled-environment physiological data collection, and outdoor environmental data collection. We find that using the data obtained through the wrist-mounted wearables, core temperature can be predicted non-invasively with 95 percent of target attainment within ±0.27 °C. Additionally, a direct connection between the air temperature at the wrist ( <italic>T</italic> <sub> <italic>a</italic> , <italic>w</italic> </sub> ) and the perceived activity level (PAV) of individuals was drawn. We observe that with increased <italic>T</italic> <sub> <italic>a</italic> , <italic>w</italic> </sub> , the desire for physical activity is significantly reduced, reaching ‘Transition only’ PAV level at 36 °C.

   abstract = {Current thermal/sensation models primarily rely on predefined formulas or empirically defined recommendations, but fail to consider each individual's physiological characteristics. Such models frequently ignore occupants' diverse physical conditions and, therefore, have critical limitations in estimating each individual's thermal sensation levels. Since the human body is governed by the thermoregulation principle to balance the heat flux between the ambient thermal condition and the body itself, skin temperature has a significant role in maintaining this physiological principle. Therefore, this study investigated the potential use of skin temperature and its technical parameters in establishing a thermal sensation. By using advanced modern sensing technologies, and existing thermal regulation model research, this study selected and validated seven body areas as significant local body segments for determining overall thermal sensation. A series of environmental chamber tests were conducted for 2 h. While the indoor temperature fluctuated between 20 °C and 30 °C, skin temperatures of the seven selected body areas were measured in conjunction with a thermal sensation and comfort survey. Results of this study revealed that combinations of skin temperatures for the arm, back, and wrist provided the significant information needed to accurately estimate the thermal sensations of each user. Most of all, both sides of the wrist generated accurate data more than 94% of the time. Therefore, considering the modern advanced wearable sensing technologies, results of this study confirmed that optimum combinations of skin temperature information from selected body areas, is reliable and generally applicable for estimating individual thermal sensations.},

   abstract = {Prior knowledge of occupants’ thermal comfort can facilitate informed control decision of ambient thermal-conditioning in a building environment. This paper investigates the possibility to predict human thermal state (Comfort/Discomfort) from the information of physiological parameters. As gender difference has been widely linked with thermal comfort perception, a four-fold objective is adopted: first, investigating gender differences in subjective thermal perception; second, investigating gender differences in physiological response under different thermal states; third, identifying those physiological features that have the potential to predict thermal state, and fourth, establishing a data-driven thermal state prediction model for each gender group using the identified features. Human subject experiments were conducted, during which five physiological responses (hand skin temperature STh, hand skin conductance SCh, pulse rate PR, blood oxygen saturation SpO2, blood pressure BP) and four subjective responses (thermal comfort, thermal preference, humidity sensation, airflow sensation) were recorded in conjunction with a thermal sensation survey while environmental conditions varied from cold/cool to neutral levels (18°C−27∘C). Additionally, derivative features namely change rate (FOG) and mean squared gradient (MSG) of each physiological parameter were examined. Rigorous statistical analysis and subsequent predictive modeling utilizing Random Forest algorithm were implemented. Results demonstrate significant gender difference in several subjective and physiological responses. The features identified for males (SpO2-MSG/STh/STh-FOG/STh-MSG/SCh/SCh-FOG/SCh-MSG) and females (STh-FOG/STh-MSG/SCh/SCh-MSG/PR/PR-MSG) could accurately predict 92.86% and 94.29% of thermal states, respectively. This study indicates that the thermal state of a person can be identified by monitoring physiological parameters from non-intrusive body locations using wearable sensing technology.},

   abstract = {A personal comfort model is an approach to thermal comfort modeling, for thermal environmental design and control, that predicts an individual's thermal comfort response, instead of the average response of a large population. We developed personal thermal comfort models using lab grade wearable in normal daily activities. We collected physiological signals (e.g., skin temperature, heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) for 2–4 weeks (at least 20 h per day). Then we trained 14 models for each subject with different machine-learning algorithms to predict their thermal preference. The results show that the median prediction power could be up to 24%/78%/0.79 (Cohen's kappa/accuracy/AUC) with all features considered. The median prediction power reaches 21%/71%/0.7 after 200 subjective votes. We explored the importance of different features on the prediction performance by considering all subjects in one dataset. When all features included for the entire dataset, personal comfort models can generate the highest performance of 35%/76%/0.80 by the most predictive algorithm. Personal comfort models display the highest prediction power when occupants' thermal sensations is outside thermal neutrality. Skin temperature measured at the ankle is more predictive than measured at the wrist. We suggest that Cohen's kappa or AUC should be employed to assess the performance of personal thermal comfort models for imbalanced datasets due to the capacity to exclude random success.},

   abstract = {Standardized methods for thermal comfort assessment already exist, namely the predicted mean vote (PMV) and the adaptive comfort model, both valid for groups of people. To identify whether a specific person is comfortable under different factors such as thermal, air quality, lighting, and acoustics, the only current reliable method is subjective evaluation. To reduce the need of occupant feedback, personal comfort models are currently being developed that aim to predict thermal response based on information from the occupant and its surroundings. These comfort models leverage machine learning tools and have been found to provide suitable estimations of personal comfort responses. According to the literature, an average prediction accuracy of 70–80% is attainable. Therefore, these models are promoted as innovative and efficient ways for comfort-based HVAC control. The challenge is however identifying the most relevant indicators and acquiring them in a simple way. Integrating anthropometric data, e.g., age, sex, and body mass index may represent a method for generating a personal comfort model. Including physiological data such as skin temperature, heart rate, and signal transformation could increase performance. Strong relationships were identified between subjective thermal response and physiological indicators, however their variation was not found to be governed solely by thermoregulation. Few automatic control implementation examples of personal comfort models using physiological indicators shows that challenges still exist. In order to achieve an accurate control, certain issues remain regarding acceptable thresholds for personal comfort model performance and the optimum set of indicators and combination to achieve it.},

   abstract = {The conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are based on a set-point control approach that only considers the temperature of the environment without reflecting the thermophysiological status of the occupant. This approach not only fails to fully satisfy individual thermal preferences, but it also makes an HVAC operation energy-inefficient. One possible solution is to control the indoor thermal condition based on an accurate prediction of the occupant's thermal comfort to prevent any unnecessary energy consumption. Here, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) wearable sensor-based human-in-the-loop HVAC control system that is operated on a real-time basis reflecting the thermophysiological condition of the occupant to automatically improve their thermal comfort while reducing the energy consumption of the building. The wristband-type, AI-based, three-point wearable temperature sensor offers excellent thermal comfort prediction accuracy (93.9%), enabling a human-centric HVAC control operation. A proof-of-concept demonstration of closed human-in-the-loop HVAC control using the AI-enabled wearable sensor system confirms both the accuracy of the thermal comfort prediction and the energy-efficiency of this approach, demonstrating its potential as a new solution that improves the occupant's thermal comfort and provides building energy savings.},

   abstract = {Thermal comfort is an essential environmental factor related to quality of life and work effectiveness. We assessed the feasibility of wrist skin temperature monitoring for estimating subjective thermal sensation. We invented a wrist band that simultaneously monitors skin temperatures from the wrist (i.e., the radial artery and ulnar artery regions, and upper wrist) and the fingertip. Skin temperatures from eight healthy subjects were acquired while thermal sensation varied. To develop a thermal sensation estimation model, the mean skin temperature, temperature gradient, time differential of the temperatures, and average power of frequency band were calculated. A thermal sensation estimation model using temperatures of the fingertip and wrist showed the highest accuracy (mean root mean square error [RMSE]: 1.26 ˘ 0.31). An estimation model based on the three wrist skin temperatures showed a slightly better result to the model that used a single fingertip skin temperature (mean RMSE: 1.39 ˘ 0.18). When a personalized thermal sensation estimation model based on three wrist skin temperatures was used, the mean RMSE was 1.06 ˘ 0.29, and the correlation coefficient was 0.89. Thermal sensation estimation technology based on wrist skin temperatures, and combined with wearable devices may facilitate intelligent control of one's thermal environment.},

This variable depends on several factors: ambient temperature, relative humidity, air speed, the clothes that the person wears, and the physical activity that they are doing, among others. Given the number of measurements to be carried out, we must already speak of a sensor node for the development of a sensor that allows the measurement of variables to estimate thermal comfort. This work presents the development and calibration of a low-cost sensor node that allows the estimation of thermal comfort through the Fanger method, for which the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) and PPD (Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied) are estimated. The development of low-cost sensors for estimating thermal comfort will allow the development of platforms to manage energy use in buildings efficiently. Finally, the experimental results of the sensor node prototype are presented and compared with standard instruments in the laboratory stage, showing the certainty of the prototype.},

In this paper, we propose a framework to learn occupant interactions from ambient sensing technologies (e.g., sensing of variables such as sound (dB), CO2 (ppm), light intensity (lux), dry-bulb temperature (°C), relative humidity (RH%), pressure (mbar)) from both stationary and wearable devices and select the technologies and averaging windows which contain the required information for learning. In this framework, several supervised machine learning algorithms are tested on the labeled datasets and the algorithm which outperforms others is selected. Two types of sensing devices were utilized for analyses: wearable devices worn around the neck by the test subjects, and a network of stationary devices located in the test subjects’ working indoor spaces. 221 employees of federal agencies housed in facilities managed by the US. General Services Administration in the mid-Atlantic and Southern states participated in this study, answering questions about their current task every hour. Overall accuracies were observed of 86.72% for wearable and stationary devices, 81.25% for only wearable-only, and 85.16% for stationary-only for prediction of the mixed multi-label classification via Random Forests algorithm. The high prediction allows for identifying subjects’ tasks when training labels are not available. Predicting occupants’ interactions as a main indicator of occupants’ behavior have significant implications for the energy efficiency of building systems (up to 20% savings).},

   abstract = {By now, there is a consensus that non-residential buildings (commercial and public buildings) present important opportunities for reducing cost, fuel inputs and greenhouse gas emissions, especially because of their intensive use of electricity. Till now, however, in emerging economies energy efficiency opportunities in buildings are typically more focused on households. In Mexico, official government statistics suggest that the non-residential sector electricity demand is low compared to the residential and industrial sectors, but previous studies suggest that non-residential electricity use is underestimated due to the reliance of electricity tariff classes, which may not adequately distinguish large commercial buildings from industrial facilities. The analysis presented here follows the same general bottom-up methodology as two recent studies, but enhances them with a more rigorous and up-to-date assessment of electricity drivers of building sub-types from a variety of sources. The result is a more reliable estimate of non-residential electricity demand by building sub-type and climate zone. Non-residential buildings electricity demand in 2017 is found to be 66.9 TWh, which is nearly three times the official estimate of 22.6 TWh in the same year. Such a large discrepancy likely distorts the picture of energy use in the country and may lead to an under-emphasis by government and private sector actors in managing energy use in this important sector.},
